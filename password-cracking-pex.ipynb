    "This Pwning Exercise (PEX) is meant to be minimal in writing new code and maximal in using what you've already been taught so far in this course. To that end, much code is provided, but it is still no small challenge to provide what is left out to crack the passwords. Every flag can be obtained by supplying the correct password to the checker. Not every level requires new code. Level 1 is defintely easiest, but there is no need to solve these Levels in order."
